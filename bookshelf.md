Below are lists of things I've read (or have read in part). Maybe you'll want to read them too.

Most of this stuff is technical, but there might be the occasionally whimsical or more generally applicable thing here.

## Google 

Although there's always [research.google.com](research.google.com), some additional and/or curated reading about life at Google:

* ["Call Me Ishmael" (2012)](https://mike-bland.com/2012/08/10/call-me-ishmael.html) - Mike Bland reflects on the challenges involved in encouraging Google engineers to test their code (Miek's blog also talks about internal infra like TAP, Forge, etc., and even for Googlers the stuff about the history of the Testing Grouplet is a great read).
* ["Modern Code Review: A Case Study at Google" (2018)](https://sback.it/publications/icse2018seip.pdf) - qualitative analysis of code review practices at Google (there's also ["CodeFlow: Improving the Code Review Process at Microsoft" (2018)](https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3292420), which is another mostly qualitative discussion, although they do have some very interesting stats).
* ["Site Reliability Engineering" (2016)](https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/toc/index.html) and its followup, ["The Site Reliability Workbook" (2018)](https://landing.google.com/sre/workbook/toc/), which discuss the art of maintaining production systems.
* ["The Datacenter as a Computer" (2018)](https://www.morganclaypool.com/doi/pdf/10.2200/S00874ED3V01Y201809CAC046) - I'm not sure if I got anything *specifically* useful from this, but in general I found it to be a nice overview of the challenges involved in operating a modern datacenter.

## Miscellaneous

* ["A Few Billion Lines of Code Later" (2010)](https://m-cacm.acm.org/magazines/2010/2/69354-a-few-billion-lines-of-code-later/fulltext), which chronicles the experiences of the folks behind Coverity as they built a product out of a research tool to identify bugs using static anlysis. A choice quote that I find summarizes the paper well: "Parsing is considered a solved problem. Unfortunately, this view is naïve, rooted in the widely believed myth that programming languages exist."
* ["Life in the Trenches of healthcare.gov" (2014)](https://www.dotconferences.com/2014/05/robert-kennedy-life-in-the-trenches-of-healthcare-gov) - a recanting of the travails that healthcare.gov went through, as summarized by a Xoogler SRE.
* ["No Silver Bullet" (1986)](http://faculty.salisbury.edu/~xswang/Research/Papers/SERelated/no-silver-bullet.pdf) - a discussion of the fundamental challenges involved in creating software.
* ["Supercomputing's Monster in the Closet" (2016)](https://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/hardware/how-to-kill-a-supercomputer-dirty-power-cosmic-rays-and-bad-solder) - "Jaguar had 360 terabytes of main memory [and] was logging ECC errors at a rate of 350 per minute." Also see [this Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/whitequark/status/980522328151834624?s=19), which is what led me to this in the first place.
* ["The Hardest Program I've Ever Written" (2015)](http://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2015/09/08/the-hardest-program-ive-ever-written/) - the story of `dartfmt`: "The hardest program I’ve ever written, once you strip out the whitespace, is 3,835 lines long. That handful of code took me almost a year to write. [...] I deleted 20,704 lines of code over that time."

## Personal

### 2020

* Jemisin, N. K. - The Fifth Season
* Jemisin, N. K. - The Obelisk Gate
* Jemisin, N. K. - The Stone Sky
* Carter, Bill - The War for Late Night
* McClelland, Cary - Silicon City: San Francisco in the Long Shadow of the Valley
* Pratchett, Terry and Neil Gaiman - Good Omens
* Attempted to start reading the Discworld series; got
  * almost halfway through *Sourcery* (started with that one because supposedly Pratchett recommended that as a starting point),
  * halfway through *Mort* (went with it next because I was curious about Death's character), and
  * maybe 40 pages each of *Small Gods* and *Feet of Clay* (the latter because I found a thread on /r/discworld saying that the thing that finally got some people into Discworld was the Watch series).
  * Ultimately, I don't think Pratchett is my cup of tea. Entertaining, certainly: I definitely appreciate the absurdism and surrealism of it. But something is missing for me - maybe it's the lack of plot (which isn't necessarily true, I definitely got to the point where I saw that *Sourcery* is about the end of the world and *Mort* is about Mort's journey), lack of rules to the reality of Discworld (e.g. why is it important to talk about A'Tuin? but of course, complaining about the lack of rules is somewhat absurd given that much of Discworld is about challenging, well, the absurd) - I can't quite pin it down, but *whatever* it is, I wasn't drawn into the world so much as just tickled by it.
* Robert Jordan's *Wheel of Time* series (books 1 through 5, *The Eye of the World* through *The Fires of Heaven*)
  * I stuck with it long enough to read a couple thousand pages, but... *ugh*. It says something that I quit before books 7-10 (which is where a lot of online discussion says it gets really bad). Jordan crafted an impressively large world, but there's a lot missing for me in pacing (the book always crescendos in the last third), narrative quality (there are occasional impressive moments, but it's mostly just... ok), character development (Nynaeve and Lan go from adults respectful and wary of each other to starstruck tragic lovers in the span of a chapter, Rand and Aviendha/Elayne/Min and a hint of Egwene? to say nothing of that Rand and Min spend maybe 5 pages together).
