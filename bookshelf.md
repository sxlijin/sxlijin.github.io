An incomplete list of things I've read. Most are formative, some are included for completeness, occasionally there's something I haven't yet read.

## Google 

Although there's always [research.google.com](research.google.com), some additional and/or curated reading about life at Google:

* ["Call Me Ishmael" (2012)](https://mike-bland.com/2012/08/10/call-me-ishmael.html) - Mike Bland reflects on the challenges involved in encouraging Google engineers to test their code (Mike's blog also talks about internal infra like TAP, Forge, etc., and even for Googlers the stuff about the history of the Testing Grouplet is a great read).
* ["Modern Code Review: A Case Study at Google" (2018)](https://sback.it/publications/icse2018seip.pdf) - qualitative analysis of code review practices at Google (there's also ["CodeFlow: Improving the Code Review Process at Microsoft" (2018)](https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3292420), which is another mostly qualitative discussion, although they do have some very interesting stats).
* ["Site Reliability Engineering" (2016)](https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/toc/index.html) and its followup, ["The Site Reliability Workbook" (2018)](https://landing.google.com/sre/workbook/toc/), which discuss the art of maintaining production systems.
* ["The Datacenter as a Computer" (2018)](https://www.morganclaypool.com/doi/pdf/10.2200/S00874ED3V01Y201809CAC046) - I'm not sure if I got anything *specifically* useful from this, but in general I found it to be a nice overview of the challenges involved in operating a modern datacenter.

## Articles

* ["A Few Billion Lines of Code Later" (2010)](https://m-cacm.acm.org/magazines/2010/2/69354-a-few-billion-lines-of-code-later/fulltext), which chronicles the experiences of the folks behind Coverity as they built a product out of a research tool to identify bugs using static anlysis. A choice quote that I find summarizes the paper well: "Parsing is considered a solved problem. Unfortunately, this view is naïve, rooted in the widely believed myth that programming languages exist."
* ["Life in the Trenches of healthcare.gov" (2014)](https://www.dotconferences.com/2014/05/robert-kennedy-life-in-the-trenches-of-healthcare-gov) - a recanting of the travails that healthcare.gov went through, as summarized by a Xoogler SRE.
* ["No Silver Bullet" (1986)](http://faculty.salisbury.edu/~xswang/Research/Papers/SERelated/no-silver-bullet.pdf) - a discussion of the fundamental challenges involved in creating software.
* ["Supercomputing's Monster in the Closet" (2016)](https://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/hardware/how-to-kill-a-supercomputer-dirty-power-cosmic-rays-and-bad-solder) - "Jaguar had 360 terabytes of main memory [and] was logging ECC errors at a rate of 350 per minute." Also see [this Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/whitequark/status/980522328151834624?s=19), which is what led me to this in the first place.
* ["The Hardest Program I've Ever Written" (2015)](http://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2015/09/08/the-hardest-program-ive-ever-written/) - the story of `dartfmt`: "The hardest program I’ve ever written, once you strip out the whitespace, is 3,835 lines long. That handful of code took me almost a year to write. [...] I deleted 20,704 lines of code over that time."
* ["We can't send mail more than 500 miles"](https://web.mit.edu/jemorris/humor/500-miles)
