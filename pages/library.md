### Google

I originally put this together back when I was at Google, trying to collate the publicly available resources I knew about so that I had something to point to when people asked me about life at Google. I don't update this much anymore.

* [Call Me Ishmael (2012)](https://mike-bland.com/2012/08/10/call-me-ishmael.html) - Mike Bland reflects on the challenges involved in encouraging Google engineers to test their code (Mike's blog also talks about internal infra like TAP, Forge, etc., and even for Googlers the stuff about the history of the Testing Grouplet is a great read).
* [Why Google Stores Billions of Lines of Code in a Single Repository (2016)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2854146) - a primer on google3's scale, both technical and organizational, and the solutions that Google has built around it
* [Site Reliability Engineering (2016)](https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/toc/index.html) and its followup, [The Site Reliability Workbook (2018)](https://landing.google.com/sre/workbook/toc/), which discuss the art of maintaining production systems.
* [Modern Code Review: A Case Study at Google (2018)](https://sback.it/publications/icse2018seip.pdf) - qualitative analysis of code review practices at Google (there's also [CodeFlow: Improving the Code Review Process at Microsoft (2018)](https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3292420), which is another mostly qualitative discussion, although they do have some very interesting stats).
* [The Datacenter as a Computer (2018)](https://www.morganclaypool.com/doi/pdf/10.2200/S00874ED3V01Y201809CAC046) - I'm not sure if I got anything *specifically* useful from this, but in general I found it to be a nice overview of the challenges involved in operating a modern datacenter.
* [Software Engineering at Google (2020)](https://abseil.io/resources/swe-book) - still haven't read this
