# Making Technology Accessible

keep seeing a pattern over and over again where we make fun of people who work on things without knowing how they work, or work on things that you disagree with.

two anecdotes:

talking with niko matsakis and jack huey at rustconf 2025: people who work on crypto from a low-income country where crypto is the only software job they can find. they go to /r/rust and get shamed, mocked, for working on crypto. they go to solana community and get amazing rust help.
