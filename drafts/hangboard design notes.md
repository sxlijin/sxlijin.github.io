the u-bolts in the back can be janked-together with pipe clamps

  

originally i was thinking you design it with a lead screw / slider mechanism but idk how to build something that locks in place for cheap (less than $5. maybe if i go up to $20 it would work)

  

just allow mounting different width plates on the hangboard back, and voila you're done

  

could also do something clever with some kind of spring system (rubber bands? or magnets, ooh) that clamps multiple shim plates. spacers will feel better, actually.

  

can use baseboard/molding wood for the hangboard surface

if you go simpler and just use a baseboard as the flat layer, you can cut a slot with a router bit (like a table saw miter guide slot) and then slide another rail in it above

  

you can also use dog holes every 2mm, and make them adjustable from the bottom
